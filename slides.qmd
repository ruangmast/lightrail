## Title Slide

Light Rails and Air Pollution

Thanicha Ruangmas and Geoffrey Zhang

AREC Research Workshop on September 26, 2022

## Intro

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Air pollution is an urgent issue harming human health.

    -   90% of the world's population is exposed to harmful pollution levels each year (WHO)

-   Has been exacerbated by traffic congestion in urban areas.

-   Cities are looking to build mass transit to reduce air pollution.

##### Light Rail Routes

::: columns
::: {.column .r-fit-text width="60%"}
-   Light rail systems in the United States can be divided into two categories: first-generation legacy systems and second-generation modern systems.

-   We focus on second-generation systems in our study opened after the 2000s (our PM2.5 dataset has data from 2000 to 2018).

-   We picked systems in cities where light rail was the primary mode of rail transit, allowing us to isolate air pollution effects resulting from the opening of a light rail.

-   Cities with a population of at least 1 million residents were picked to ensure light rails were in urban cities.

-   After considering these criteria, our panel of cities was narrowed down to four systems:

    **Charlotte, NC's LYNX system, Houston, TX's METRORail system, Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN's METRO system, and Seattle, WA's Link system.**

## Data

##### PM2.5
::: columns
::: {.column .r-fit-text width="55%"}
-   To calculate PM2.5, we use the North America Regional Estimates of Chemical Composition of Fine Particulate Matter (V4.NA.03) dataset from Washington University in St. Louis that estimates ground-level PM2.5 from 2000 to 2018.

-   This dataset estimates PM2.5 by combining Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from NASA's MODIS, MISR, and SeaWIFS instruments, providing us with air pollution data across the United States at a gridded resolution of 0.01Â°.

-   We use this data to calculate the monthly mean PM2.5 before and after the opening of a light rail system for a 10km buffer around each of our control cities' city centers.

-   City center coordinates were found by using the Google Maps Geocoding API.
