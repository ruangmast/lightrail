## Monthly Average PM2.5

For each city, we draw a 10 km buffer around the original light rail line, and find the monthly average of all data points within the buffer area.

+----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia metropolitan area | PM2.5 data points within the 10 km buffer |
|                                              |                                           |

## Summary Statistics

Our period of study is in four cities from January 2001 to December 2011, before any light rail expansion occurred.

df<-read.csv("G:/Shared drives/2022 FIRE-SA/ARCHIVED - SUMMER INTERNSHIP/CODE/combined.csv")

ss<-df %>%
  ungroup() %>%

  dplyr::summarise(avgpm25=mean(meanpm25),
                   sdpm25=sd(meanpm25),

                              "Opening Date",
                              "Opening Status",
                              "Avg PM2.5",
                              "SD PM2.5",
                              "Max PM2.5",
                              "Obs")) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

## Summary Statistics

-   According to the EPA NAAQs standard, annual mean PM2.5, averaged across three years should not exceed $12 \mu g / m^3$.

-   None of the counties we are studying had non-attainment status for PM2.5, but Maricopa County in Arizona has partial non-attainment status for PM10.

```{r}

op2 %>%
  kbl(digits=1, col.names = c("City", 
                              "Opening Date",
                              "Opening Status",
                              "Avg PM2.5",
                              "SD PM2.5",
                              "Max PM2.5",
                              "Obs")) %>%
  kable_styling()

```

## Average Effect Empirical Strategy

-   Similar to Gendron-Carrier et al. (2022) we examine the changes in ground-level PM2.5 alongside the sharp opening dates of light rails.

-   We compare PM2.5 levels before and after light rail openings with the regression:

$$
P_{it} = \beta_i + \alpha_1 D_{it} + \gamma' X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

where $D_{it}=1$ when light rail in city $i$ in month $t$ has opened, and $D_{it}=0$ otherwise.

-   Other controls include city fixed effects, year fixed effects, city-month of year fixed effects to capture city-level pollution trends.

-   We also include linear and quadratic climate variables such as cloud cover percentage, frost day frequency, mean temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure.

-   All regressions include year FE, city FE, city-month FE, linear and quadratic climate controls.

## Event Study Empirical Strategy

-   In an event study, we compare PM2.5 levels each month, 18 months before and after light rail openings. Our regression specification is:

$$
P_{it}=\beta_i + \sum_{j = -18,..18} \alpha_j D_{it} (j) + \gamma' X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
$$

-   Let $D_{it} (j)$ represent dummy variables that is equal to 1 when our observation is $j$ months since the light rail opened in city $i$ at month $t$.

-   $\alpha_j$ represents the impact of light rail opening in month $j$ after opening.

-   We ran the regression for two time periods; from 2001 to 2011 across all cities, and the 18 months before and 18 months after light rail opening in each city.

-   Other controls include city fixed effects, year fixed effects, city-month fixed effects, linear and quadratic climate variables, and the number of PM2.5 data points.

## Event Study Results

-   In other regression, we restrict our data to include only the 18 month period before and after light rail openings in each city.

-   The graph below shows the values of $\hat{\alpha_j}$ from the regression equation $P_{it}=\beta_i + \sum_{j} \alpha_j D_{it} (j) + \gamma' X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$
